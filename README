= TinyTest

TinyTest rips off minitest-1.3.0.

Developed on: ruby 1.8.7 (2008-08-11 patchlevel 72) [i386-mswin32]


== TODO

  * Write test
    -- tinytest/util flips its function based on
    detail of Ruby interpreter's behavior, so it's impossible to fill
    test coverage by only one interpreter.
  * Write RDoc
    -- by broken English :-(
  * Compatible to test/unit
  * Outfit customize API


== Future Features

  * Enable to define original assertion by user.
  * Control output about test result.
  * Enable to define refute easyly.
